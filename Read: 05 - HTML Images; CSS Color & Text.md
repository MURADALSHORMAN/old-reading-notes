#### Choosing Images for Your Site

A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.

Images should
- Be relevant
- Convey information
- Convey the right mood
- Be instantly recognisable
- Fit the color palette

If you are building a site from scratch, it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses.

#### Adding Images

```
<img src="..." title="...." />
```
