# CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

The transition property has three values: the properties to transition (in our case all of them) the speed of the transition (in our case 0.3 seconds) and a third value which lets you change how the acceleration and deceleration is calculated, but we’ll stick with the default by leaving this blank.

1. Fade in

Having things fade in is a fairly common request from clients. It’s a great way to emphasize functionality or draw attention to a call to action.

Fade in effects are coded in two steps: first, you set the initial state; next, you set the change, for example on hover:
```
.fade
{
        opacity:0.5;
}
.fade:hover
{
        opacity:1;
}


```

2. Change color
Animating a change of color used to be unbelievably complex, with all kinds of math involved in calculating separate RGB values and then recombining them. Now, we just set the div’s class to “color” and specify the color we want in our CSS:
```
.color:hover
{
        background:#53a7ea;
}
```

3. Grow & Shrink
To grow an element, you used to have to use its width and height, or its padding. But now we can use CSS3’s transform to enlarge.

Set your div’s class to “grow” and then add this code to your style block:
```
.grow:hover
{
        -webkit-transform: scale(1.3);
        -ms-transform: scale(1.3);
        transform: scale(1.3);
}

```

Shrinking an element is as simple as growing it. To enlarge an element we specify a value greater than 1, to shrink it, we specify a value less than 1:
```
.shrink:hover
{
        -webkit-transform: scale(0.8);
        -ms-transform: scale(0.8);
        transform: scale(0.8);
}


```

4. Rotate elements

CSS transforms have a number of different uses, and one of the best is transforming the rotation of an element. Give your div the class “rotate” and add the following to your CSS:
```
.rotate:hover
{
        -webkit-transform: rotateZ(-30deg);
        -ms-transform: rotateZ(-30deg);
        transform: rotateZ(-30deg);
}

```
5. Square to circle
A really popular effect at the moment is transitioning a square element into a round one, and vice versa. With CSS, it’s a simple effect to achieve, we just transition the border-radius property.

Give your div the class “circle” and add this CSS to your styles:
```
.circle:hover
{
        border-radius:50%;
}
```

6. 3D shadow
3D shadows were frowned upon for a year or so, because they weren’t seen as compatible with flat design, which is of course nonsense, they work fantastically well to give a user feedback on their interactions and work with flat, or fake 3D interfaces.

This effect is achieved by adding a box shadow, and then moving the element on the x axis using the transform and translate properties so that it appears to grow out of the screen.

Give your div the class “threed” and then add the following code to your CSS:
```
.threed:hover
{
        box-shadow:
                1px 1px #53a7ea,
                2px 2px #53a7ea,
                3px 3px #53a7ea;
        -webkit-transform: translateX(-3px);
        transform: translateX(-3px);
}
```


7.Inset border
One of the hottest button styles right now is the ghost button; a button with no background and a heavy border. We can of course add a border to an element simply, but that will change the element’s position. We could fix that problem using box sizing, but a far simpler solution is the transition in a border using an inset box shadow.

Give your div the class “border” and add the following CSS to your styles:
```
.border:hover
{
        box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 25px #53a7ea;
}
```
