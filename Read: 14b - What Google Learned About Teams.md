# How to build the perfect team

Before approaching this question, we must first define what exactly makes a team. Innumerable possible definitions all seem to share three common elements: group, purpose, 
and interdependence. A team, therefore, is a group of individuals working together to achieve their common goal.

#### What is the lifecycle of a team?

It can take some time for a team to develop, a process which formed the focus of Bruce Tuckman’s research which started in the 1960s. Tuckman’s article ‘Developmental Sequence 
in Small Groups’ 1965, expanded following further research in 1977, concluded that teams typically go through 5 key stages as they form and develop: forming, storming, norming, 
performing and adjourning.

His team development model (pictured) identifies the interactions that occur within teams at each stage, as well as the types of feelings and behaviours associated with each.
For example, Tuckman identified that, when first brought together, there is generally a period of getting acquainted with fellow members within a team.People are often hesitant
to initiate activities and take on responsibility at this stage, looking instead to the team leader for direction.

### Project Aristotle – why do some teams succeed where others don’t?

Tuckman’s model acknowledges that some teams progress to succeed,
while others struggle. In 2012, Google kicked off Project Aristotle(1), which saw statisticians, organisational psychologists, sociologists and researchers analyse hundreds of 
teams over three years trying to find the recipe for building the perfect team.

The research and analysis remit of the project was massive. They looked at social interaction, gender, hobbies, education, personality, team boundaries, performance,
reward structures and more, all with the aim of establishing the key identifying features of a successful team.

The conclusion, however, after three years of extensive research, was that the composition of a team made no difference to its effectiveness; there were no strong patterns 
in the results and team effectiveness seemed to be a lottery.


Research on Group IQ, published in Science in 2010, had pointed to the importance of group norms, identifying two behaviours that collectively intelligent teams generally displayed:

1) Equality in distribution of conversational turn taking (members speak roughly the same proportion of time)

2) Above average social sensitivity (intuiting how others feel based on tone of voice, expressions and other non-verbal cues)
